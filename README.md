# OOP Hometask on classes

Here we consider classes of two types - Students and Mentors. Mentors have two subclasses - Lecturers and Reviewers. 

- Lecturers only read the course. 
- Reviewers can mark students with grades for their homework. 
- Students can give a report about the lecturer.

The examples of their interactions are presented in the main.py file. 

Functions for calculation of average grades are also created.
